# Spring Mobile Samples

[!["Build Status"](https://build.spring.io/plugins/servlet/buildStatusImage/MOBILE-SAMPLES)](https://build.spring.io/browse/MOBILE-SAMPLES)

[Spring Mobile] is an extension to the popular [Spring Web MVC] web framework that aims to simplify the development of mobile web applications. This repository contains sample projects illustrating usage of Spring Mobile. See [Spring Mobile on GitHub] for more information about building from source.


## Sample Applications

The following sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of [Spring Mobile] server-side device detection and [Spring Boot] auto-configuration. See the README within each sample project for more information and additional instructions.

 - [lite-device-resolver] - DeviceResolver functionality and usage 
 - [lite-site-preference-handler-jsp] - SitePreferenceHandler functionality with JSP views
 - [lite-device-delegating-view-resolver] - sample app showing view names adjusted based on device type
 - [lite-device-delegating-view-resolver-jsp] - JSP alternative illustrating adjusted views
 
## Archived Sample Applications

There are several sample applications that illustrate Java or XML based configuration that have been archived, as Spring Boot is now the preferred way of building and configuring a Spring application. These sample apps have been moved to the [`archive`](archive/) folder.
