This sample app demonstrates many of the capabilities of the Spring Mobile Device module, including:
- "Lite" device resolution
- Site preference management
- Site switching

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the project at http://localhost:8080/lite-showcase

Note: In order for the site switcher demonstration to work in a local test environment, you will need to add the following to your hosts file; for example, /etc/hosts on Unix and MacOS systems:
127.0.0.1    testdomain.com
127.0.0.1    m.testdomain.com
