# lite-device-delegating-view-resolver-jsp

A [Spring Mobile] sample application demonstrating many of the capabilities of the Spring Mobile Device module, including:

* "Lite" device resolution through the use of DeviceResolverHandlerInterceptor 
* Site preference management via SitePreferenceHandlerInterceptor
* View resolution with LiteDeviceDelegatingViewResolver
* Spring Boot auto-configuration
* JSP views


## Auto-configuration

[Spring Boot] support is enabled through a property defined in `application.properties`. By default `LiteDeviceDelegatingViewResolver` is disabled in Spring Mobile auto-configuration. If the following property is not declared or is set to false, then this feature will be disabled.

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
```
spring.mobile.devicedelegatingviewresolver.enabled: true
```
